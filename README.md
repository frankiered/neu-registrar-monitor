2. Install Playwright in your IDE with `pip install playwright` then `playwright install firefox`

3. Replace the course list with courses that you would like to monitor for.

4. Input your Discord webhook and NEU credentials.

5. Run `py bot.py`

6. When Duo authentication appears, accept it and your browser will automatically store the cookies.

7. You're done! Leave it running and the monitor will send a Discord embed when a given class has availability.
